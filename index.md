## About-me
I am currently a ~~2nd year~~ 3rd year **Computer Engineer** major at UCSD.
My experience using *Github* is __very__ limited and close to ***negligible***.
A quote I think is a good life motto is
>"Be brave, stay wild" - Coyote Peterson

My favorite piece of code is still:
```
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
```
because it is a good gateway to learning code.

My [First Repository](https://github.com/KurtisMa/CSE110-Lab1.git) is for a CSE110 lab.
